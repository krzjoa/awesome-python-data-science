# Contibution guideline
If you came here, I suppose you would like to add a lib this list. To do it well, you should follow these rules.

1. Take a critical look: is the proposed lib really awesome?
2. If does, add this lib in the relevant section at the last positionn. Bear in mind, that in many cases one library may fit multiple categories. Choose exactly one, to not duplicate contents.
3. Obviously, check if the library does not occur in the list!
4. Adorn with coresponding icon(s) if possible (such as sklearn, TensorFlow and so on).
5. Desctiption should start with a capital letter and be ended with proper punctuation.
6. Feel free to propose any other changes in the list. New section? Removing an item? No problem, we'll think about it :sunglasses:
